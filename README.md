## üèóÔ∏è Building from Source üèóÔ∏è

If you'd like to build the mod yourself:

1.  **Clone this repository.**
2.  **Set up Game Libraries:**
    *   The project references game and BepInEx DLLs from a local folder named `_GameOriginalLibs`.
    *   Run the `update_local_libs.ps1` PowerShell script located in the root of the repository. This script will attempt to copy the necessary DLLs from a standard Valheim installation path (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Valheim`).
    *   If your Valheim installation is in a different location, you'll need to edit the `$valheimBasePath` variable at the top of `update_local_libs.ps1` before running it.
    *   The script copies files like `BepInEx.dll`, `0Harmony.dll`, `assembly_valheim.dll`, `UnityEngine.dll`, and `UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll` into the `_GameOriginalLibs` directory.
3.  **Open the Solution:** Open `FeatherCapeJump.sln` in Visual Studio.
4.  **Install .NET SDK:** Ensure you have the .NET SDK (as specified in the project file, likely .NET Framework 4.7.2) installed.
5.  **Restore NuGet Packages:** Visual Studio should do this automatically, or you can do it manually.
6.  **Build the Solution:** Build the solution in `Release` configuration. The `FeatherCapeJump.dll` will be located in `bin/Release/net472/`.

**Build Workflow:**
The `update_local_libs.ps1` script is crucial for local development. It ensures that the project has access to the required game assemblies. When you build the project in Visual Studio, it compiles `Class1.cs` (and any other C# files) against these libraries, producing `FeatherCapeJump.dll`.

The project also includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) to automatically build and create releases on pushes to the `master` branch that are tagged (e.g., `v1.0.0`). This automated workflow handles the build process in a clean environment.
